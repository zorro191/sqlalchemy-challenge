SQLAlchemy Homework - Surfs Up!


We have decided to treat ourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii! To help with your trip planning, you need to do some climate analysis on the area. 

The analysis included a range of 3-15 days total.

We also used a query to view rainfall in the last year.  

We plotted the data to show where there was more rain and when. 

This will allow us to pick the best place and time to plan our trip.
